    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    //passed by reference!
    // now here is the problem!
    // console.log(players);
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      const team2 = players.slice()
      team2[3] = 'boris'
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players)
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    const team5 = Array.from(players)
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Monica',
      age: 20,
    }

    // and think we make a copy:
    const leader = person;
    // leader.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99})
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
